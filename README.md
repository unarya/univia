## Prerequisites

- **Go**: 1.21 or higher
- **Docker**: 20.10 or higher
- **Mysql**: 8.0 or higher
- **Redis**: 7.0 or higher
- **Make**: (optional) for build automation

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unarya/univia.git
cd univia
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Copy the example environment file and configure your settings:

```bash
cp configs/.env.example configs/.env
```

### 3. Development Mode

Use the development script to start all services:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

The `run.sh` script will:
- Start required Docker containers (Mysql, Redis)
- Run database migrations
- Seed initial data (roles, permissions, admin user)
- Start the API server with hot reload
- Start the WebRTC signaling server

**Services will be available at:**
- API Gateway: `http://localhost:2000`
- WebRTC Server: `ws://localhost:2112`
- API Documentation: `http://localhost:2000/swagger/index.html`

### 4. Production Deployment

For production deployment, use the release script:

```bash
chmod +x release.sh
./release.sh <alpha/beta> <version> <stage>
# ./release.sh alpha v0.0.2 3 -> v0.0.2-alpha.3
```

The `release.sh` script will:
- Build optimized Docker images
- Run security scans
- Execute test suites
- Create production-ready artifacts
- Generate deployment manifests
- Push images to container registry (if configured)

## Project Structure

### `/api`
Application documentation.
### `/cmd`
Application entry points for different microservices:
- `api`: Main API gateway
- `signaling`: WebRTC signaling server
- `sfu`: SFU server

### `/internal`
Internal application logic organized by domain:
- `api/`: RestAPI business logic
- `signaling/`: WebRTC business logic
- `infrastructure/`: 3rd party client config
- `sfu/`: SFU service business logic

### `/pkg`
Reusable packages shared across services:
- `models/`: Shared models
- `signaling/`: WebRTC implementation
- `types/`: Types public implementation
- `utils/`: Helpers implementation

### `/infra`
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for deployment: (Not-yet updated)
- `docker/`: Docker and Docker Compose files
- `kubernetes/`: Kubernetes manifests
- `terraform/`: Terraform configurations
- `helm/`: Helm charts

### `/configs`
Configuration files for different environments:
- `.env.development`
- `.env.staging`
- `.env.production`

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run integration tests
go test -tags=integration ./test/integration/...
```

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, access the interactive API documentation:

- **Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:2000/swagger/index.html`

### Authentication

Most endpoints require authentication. To authenticate:

1. Register a new user: `POST /api/v1/auth/register`
2. Login: `POST /api/v1/auth/login`
3. Use the returned token in the `Authorization` header: `Bearer <token>`
